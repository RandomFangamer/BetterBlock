# The future of this engine
I created The BetterBlock Engine to fill what I saw as a major gap in the Community.

Up until I created the engine, the only movable block resources were in the Yosniper engine and its derivatives, and those were far from ideal or flexible. Platforms were also very limited in use due to their spaghetti code, which I believe stems from Tijit's engine.

I wanted to fix these issues because, at the time, no one else was focused on it, at least as far as I could tell.

So I had my game plan: I would create flexible platforms and movable blocks that could be added into any GMS1 YoYoYo engine game.



To say I was unqualified for the job would be an understatement.

The new block and platform objects in this engine went through many redesigns over the course of this engine's development, and they needed that.

The GameMaker engine didn't help with this job either. Why GMS uses Gaussian rounding is beyond me. That alone accounts for a lot of the unexplained garbage code in objBetterBlock and objBetterMovingPlatform.

My first attempts at creating them were incredibly bad. The versions I ended up releasing are better, but not perfect.



Flash forward nearly one and a half years.

The assets have been used by a lot of good fangames:

Not Another Needle Contest 2, IW Save the Ship, IWBT Flashback, and so on. Even the intro to the 2021 Fangame Awards used them.

So why stop working on the engine now?

To be honest, I'm exhausted from trying to "patch the leaking dam" for the last 1.5 years.

More importantly, there's a better alternative.

Verve's engine, which is also based on the YoYoYo engine, has also filled that gap.

Maybe I inspired Verve to add objBlockDynamic into their engine, or maybe they would have done so even if I never created this project. Either way, I'm more than happy to pass this on to them. I would much rather work on my new projects than maintain this one.

Everyone is still free to use these objects as they wish. You're even free to go create a "The Better-erBlock Engine" if you want to.

Lastly, thank you to everyone who alerted me to problems in the engine. I hope I didn't mess up your fangames too much.
