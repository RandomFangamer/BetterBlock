Version 1.11 (11/14/20):
 - Improved the platform wheel code to make it more readable
 - Adjusted the way the player's top/bottom/left/rightToOrigin values are calculated to be more logical
TODO: BetterPlatforms will pull the player through block (not BetterBlock) instances that are outside the room. This still needs to be fixed.

Version 1.1 (11/9/20):
 - Updated the BetterBlock and BetterPlatform code so they will now work regardless of the Player's mask and origin.

Version 1.0 (8/1/20):
 - Initial Release
